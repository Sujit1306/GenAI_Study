    "1. **Improved Context Management**: By breaking the task into smaller prompts, the model can focus on one aspect at a time. Reducing the risk of loosing context in long inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Modularity**: You can reuse or rearrange nodes for different tasks, making the system flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Debugging**: If something goes wrong, it is easier to pinpoint which step failed and adjust the prompt or logic accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Complex Reasoning**: Chaining prompts allows the model to \"think\" step-by-step, mimicking human problem-solving more effectively. "
