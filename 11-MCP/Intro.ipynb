    "MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a new standard developed by Anthropic (the company behind Claude) for connecting LLMs with external tools, APIs, and data sources in a structured way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Without MCP → You need to manually write custom code (API wrappers, integrations, etc.) for your LLM agent to fetch data or use a tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "- With MCP → You follow a common protocol that defines how an LLM can discover, call, and interact with external resources (APIs, DBs, tools, files, etc.) safely and consistently."

    "### Key Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Standardization – Instead of reinventing integrations, MCP defines a universal language so any tool that follows MCP can plug into any LLM agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Context-Aware – The LLM gets structured data (not just raw text) so it can reason better.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Safety – By defining what tools are available and what data can be accessed, MCP avoids the risk of agents hallucinating APIs or making unsafe calls."
